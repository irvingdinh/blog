I’ve been talking about the VM-operated AI agents idea, but my company policy is very strict about VM networking, which is preventing me from building the helper agents I wanted.

I’m in the product software engineering team, working on this as a side project for my team — not in the DevX team that gets exceptions anyway. So today I’m switching to using GitHub Actions to run the AI agents in my free time instead. Wish me luck!
