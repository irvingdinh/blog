I successfully did what I planned!

I spun up a new Ubuntu Desktop VM (inside my 96GB RAM home lab 😎) and let Claude Code control it from the beginning.

I installed n8n and let Claude Code control n8n too — I literally didn’t create any workflow.

I wired Claude Code to Linear (via n8n), and now, at 1AM, I’m still instructing Claude Code via Linear issues and comments 🤯

Can’t wait to see how far this can go, woo hoo!
