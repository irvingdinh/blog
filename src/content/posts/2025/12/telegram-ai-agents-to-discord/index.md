It’s so chaotic to communicate with AI agents via Telegram. It’s only 4 agents, but the chat is already exploding 🫨

Moving to Discord — each of my slice of life will have a separated set of agents / Discord server / n8n instance.

Two first ones are my “working for employer” setup and a control plan setup, which oversees the “working for employer” setup and more setups later!
