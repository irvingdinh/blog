Here we go — I'm starting a new blog.

The idea is simple: a place to share my journey as a software engineer, and also just as a person navigating life. Not everything has to be about code, right?

I'm hoping this becomes a useful notebook for myself. A way to document projects, ideas, and the occasional struggle. And hey, it might even come in handy during interviews when someone asks about my past work — instead of stumbling through memories, I can just point them here.

Let's see if I can keep this going for a while. Wish me luck! 🤞
