title: "Automating My Blog Workflow With n8n"
tags: [automation, n8n, blogging]

Today I set up a small but exciting automation in n8n to help with my blogging workflow. The idea is simple: I write a rough version of a post, n8n sends it off to get rephrased and cleaned up, then it automatically pushes the final version online to my blog.

It still feels a bit magical seeing a messy draft turn into a publish-ready post without me copy–pasting between tools. This should make it much easier for me to share quick updates like this more often, without overthinking the editing process.

I’ll write a proper article soon that walks through how the automation works end-to-end — from triggers, to AI rephrasing, to publishing — so if you’re curious about wiring up a similar setup with n8n, stay tuned.
