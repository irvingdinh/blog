I'm using CodeRabbit and Cursor Agent Review to look over my work before submitting it. They're great, but it still feels like it's not enough for me.

I'm thinking about re-reading books like Refactoring and that pragmatic software engineer book to write myself a guideline for how I want my work to be reviewed.

The idea is to let AI agents use that guideline to review my work for me. I'm imagining multiple agents spinning up at the same time, each focusing on a different space: correctness, conventions, performance, security, etc.

With the power of Claude Code Max x20, I just hope the quota is large enough for all of this 😭
