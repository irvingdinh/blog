title: "A Confidential NotebookLM-Style Setup With Codex CLI"

I'm thinking about a NotebookLM look-a-like, but with confidentiality in mind.

The idea is to have a VM that hosts Codex CLI (which I'm allowed to use at work). Each "project" is just a folder that I'll prepare manually at first (and later automate) with all the project-related documents, repositories, and other context.

On top of that, I could build a simple chat bot or StackOverflow-like interface that triggers Codex CLI to jump into the right folder and answer questions using only what's inside that folder.

This way, I still get rich, context-aware answers without depending on non-approved tools — and it's very cost-effective because it's all powered by a single agents CLI tool.
